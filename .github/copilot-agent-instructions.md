Must on each session.

1. Run `flutter test` before starting any tasks. All tests must pass. Refactor or fix failing tests. If a failing test does not validate real user logic, delete it and update your approach accordingly.

2. Use `dart format .` and `dart analyze` frequently. Resolve all warnings and errors.

3. Only modify production code for requested features or bug fixes. Justify all major changes in commit messages and documentation.

4. Use Riverpod for all state and business logic. Use dependency injection and unique identifiers (IDs) for specific robo tests to facilitate easy testing.

Before completing each session, compile the project with `flutter run` and wait for the APK to be generated.
