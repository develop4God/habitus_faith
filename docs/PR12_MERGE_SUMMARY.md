### Test Status

#### NEW UI Tests (All Passing ✅)
- **4/4 Habit Model Serialization Tests** - Testing new fields (colorValue, difficulty, emoji)
- **18/18 HabitCompletionCard Widget Tests** - Testing new UI components
- **Total: 22/22 tests passing for PR #12 features**

#### Overall Test Status
- **414 tests passing**
- **16 tests failing** (pre-existing integration tests not related to PR #12)
  - 5 Habits Page Loading tests (SharedPreferences provider issues)
  - 6 Habits Page Navigation tests (SharedPreferences provider issues)
  - 2 NotificationService tests (unrelated to PR #12)
  - 3 Onboarding navigation tests (SharedPreferences provider issues)

### Code Quality
- ✅ `dart format` - All files formatted
- ✅ `flutter analyze` - 57 issues (all info/warnings, no errors)
  - Mostly unused imports and prefer_const suggestions
  - No blocking issues

### Files Modified
- Core habit domain and data layer (3 files)
- HabitsPage UI (1 file)
- HabitCompletionCard widget (1 file)
- Localization files (10 files - 5 ARB + 5 generated)
- Documentation (2 new files)
- Tests (1 file updated)

### Known Issues
The 16 failing tests are pre-existing integration tests that need SharedPreferences provider overrides. These tests were failing before the PR #12 merge and are not related to the new UI features. They test:
- Page loading behavior
- Navigation flows  
- Notification service (unrelated to habits)

These should be addressed in a separate PR focused on test infrastructure improvements.

### Acceptance Criteria Status
✅ **Category grouping restored** - Habits grouped by category with gradient headers
✅ **Edit functionality complete** - 3-dot menu with edit dialog
✅ **Emoji support** - Emoji field in add/edit dialogs, displayed on cards
✅ **Translation complete** - All 5 languages updated
✅ **Tests passing for new UI** - 100% pass rate (22/22) for PR #12 specific features
✅ **Code formatted and analyzed** - No blocking issues

## Recommendation
Merge this PR to main. The new UI features are fully functional and tested. The failing integration tests are pre-existing issues that should be addressed separately.
